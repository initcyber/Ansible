# Ansible Playbook for Cloud-Init Ubuntu

This is a simple Ansible Playbook I am still working on to (code refactoring) in order to streamline as well as make the code work better. I am in the process of also trying to make the playbook work for multi-distributions in the future.

### To Do
Add section to install Qemu Tools (libguestfs) on Proxmox Server if its not installed
Add section to inject SSH Keys
